UWIR - Underwater Image Restoration

Neural network that restores underwater images that suffer from underwater image degradation.

This is a personal project that I am working on as a learning experience. As a certified diver, this challenge interests me and is something I can relate too. With over 100 dives, I have witnessed the beauty of the world underwater and experienced the effects it has on light and color. Using an underwater camera, a challenge that I always face is; loss of color, contrast, and particles in the water. A lot of time is spent post-processing photos to restore them and bring out their true beauty. My goal is to create a program that can automatically post-process underwater images with limited user input. This will be a complete project that will begin from model training and end at model deployment. I plan to learn a lot about the process of not only training models but also deploying models in the real world.

This Area is divided in Stages as the process goes on during development.

Stage #1: The foundation and the internal structure of the network is finally functional. This stage will be focused on one set of photos, 1 edited and 1 orginal. This stage will also allow me to play with different settings and configurations to discover the best layout for the next stage.

Old: Best results yet. For the first time stage1 has a working layout that apears to work on a heavily augmented image. More tweaking needed.
